### <b>Why is AstronomyPic?</b>
AstronomyPic is an application which came to life in order for users to upload a photograph of unusual activity in the sky such as Asteroids or Near Earth Objects.

The application consists of two screens. The first screen is the landing page which informs the user about what the app is about. The second screen is the form which allows the user to fill out the form. An external screen is then integrated into the application once the 'Send Email' button has been pressed. 

The user is able to upload or take of photograph and submit it onto the form. The user must then enter the 'Name of Observer' and 'Email of Observer' on the form. If the user wishes to, they may add extra notes regarding the photograph. The user can either reset or send the email. Once the user has clicked the 'Send Email' button, an external screen from the Mail app opens with the relevant details.

The details which get added are:

<li>Name of Observer</li>
<li>Email of Observer - This email address get CC'd the email.</li>
<li>Extra Notes</li>
<li>Location and Date Time - This is dependent on the source of the image.</li>
<li>Image</li>
<br>

The user is able to delete, save the draft email or send the email. The user is also able to edit the email if they wish to add additional information. Once the email has been sent, the email will be sent to NASA and the email will also be CC'd to the 'Email of Observer'.

### <b>Keyboard:</b>

The keyboard will be present when a text field has been selected. It will cover the tab bar at the bottom. However, when you click on anywhere apart from a text field, the keyboard dissapears and you are able to click on the other tabs.
